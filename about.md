Urban Tech Gardens (UTG) is part of the Learnable LLC universe, providing engaging learning experiences for our readers.

I am Michele ([and here is my personal site](http://mprat.org)). I have always been a tinkerer, and recently discovered gardening and growing plants in my urban (rented) home as a hobby outside my day job. This blog aims to document my journey in growing plants that I enjoy, and doing some DIY tech projects while doing so. I hope you enjoy it too!
