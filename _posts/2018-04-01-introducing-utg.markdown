Welcome to Urban Tech Garden!

<!--more-->

This website will try to:

* Document my own journey with urban agriculture
* Provide recommendations to fellow urban gardeners
* Show lots of pretty pictures!
* Discuss gardening, urban agriculture, and growing in urban environments

My plants and my garden as a life of its own:

{% include not_art.md %}

Here at UTG, we try to learn by doing. Anything we build, we'll document. Anything we buy, we'll review. Anything we learn, we'll share. As the season progresses, we'll try to document our gardening and building adventures this spring.

If there are any topics you, my readers, want to learn about, please get in touch and we'll do our best!
